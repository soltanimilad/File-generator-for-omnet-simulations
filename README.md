SUMO Scenario Generator

🌐 Overview

The SUMO Scenario Generator is a desktop application built with Python and PyQt5 designed to streamline the creation of realistic traffic simulation scenarios for SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility), specifically optimized for Veins (Vehicles in Network Simulation) projects.

This tool allows users to visually select a geographical area using an interactive Leaflet map, configure key simulation parameters (duration, vehicle count), and automatically generate all necessary SUMO and Veins configuration files.

Key Features

Interactive Map Selection: Use an embedded web engine (LeafletJS) to draw a bounding box over any area in the world to define the simulation region.

Automated File Generation: One-click generation of the core SUMO files:

.osm (OpenStreetMap data)

.net.xml (Road network file generated by Netconvert)

.rou.xml (Vehicle routes generated by DUAROUTER)

.sumo.cfg (SUMO configuration file)

.launchd.xml and omnetpp.ini (Veins/OMNeT++ configuration files)

Integrated Logging: Real-time feedback on the netconvert, polyconvert, randomTrips.py, and duarouter execution steps.

⚙️ Requirements

This application has two sets of requirements: Python dependencies for the GUI, and the external SUMO suite for the simulation logic.

1. Python Dependencies

The application requires Python 3.8+ and the following packages, which can be installed via pip:

Package

Purpose

PyQt5

Core Graphical User Interface (GUI) framework.

PyQtWebEngine

Required for displaying the interactive Leaflet map within the application.

numpy & pandas

Used for potential data processing within the application.

2. External Simulation Software (Mandatory)

The application relies heavily on the SUMO tools (e.g., netconvert, duarouter). You must have a fully functioning SUMO installation available on your system.

Crucial Setup: The application attempts to locate the SUMO tools using the SUMO_HOME environment variable. Ensure this variable is set:

# Example for Linux/macOS, modify path as needed
export SUMO_HOME="/path/to/your/sumo/installation"


🚀 Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the application installed and running on your local machine.

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/sumo-scenario-generator.git](https://github.com/yourusername/sumo-scenario-generator.git)
cd sumo-scenario-generator


Step 2: Set up a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.

# Create the environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\activate


Step 3: Install Python Packages

Install all required Python packages using the provided requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Step 4: Run the Application

Execute the main application file. The GUI window should appear.

python3 main_app.py


(Note: Replace main_app.py with the actual name of your entry script if different.)

💡 Usage

Select Area (Map Tab): On the Leaflet map, use the Rectangle Tool (usually on the right side of the map) to draw a bounding box defining your desired simulation area.

Configure Parameters: Enter a descriptive Filename, the total Duration (in seconds) for the simulation, and the total number of Vehicles (trips) to generate.

Generate Files: Click the Generate Simulation Files button.

Monitor Log: Switch to the Process Log tab to observe the steps as the application downloads OSM data, runs Netconvert, DUAROUTER, and writes the configuration files.

Output: All generated files (e.g., MyScenario.net.xml, MyScenario.sumo.cfg) will be placed in the directory where the application was executed.
